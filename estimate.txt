RTO and RPO are two important metrics used in business continuity and disaster recovery planning.

RTO, or Recovery Time Objective, is the targeted duration within which a system or service should be recovered and restored after a disruption, representing the maximum tolerable downtime.

RPO, or Recovery Point Objective, indicates the targeted point in time to which data must be recovered to resume normal operations after a disruption, signifying the maximum acceptable amount of data loss.

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: With a Multi-AZ configuration, where the database is replicated synchronously to a standby replica in another Availability Zone (AZ), the minimum RTO for a single AZ outage can be relatively low. The failover process can be automated, and the database can be quickly promoted to the standby replica, typically within minutes. Thus, a minimum RTO in the range of minutes can be achievable for recovering from a single AZ outage.
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: In the event of a complete regional outage, where all AZs in a region are affected, the RTO will be higher compared to a single AZ outage. Recovering from a regional outage requires additional considerations, such as cross-region replication, DNS updates, and potentially rebuilding the infrastructure in another region. Achieving a minimum RTO in this scenario would typically take longer, ranging from hours to potentially several hours or more, depending on the complexity of the setup and the recovery procedures in place.
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: In a Multi-AZ configuration, where synchronous replication is employed, the minimum RPO for a single AZ outage can be relatively low. Synchronous replication ensures that data is replicated to the standby replica in real-time, resulting in minimal data loss. Achieving a minimum RPO in this scenario can be in the order of seconds or less, depending on the replication latency between AZs.
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage: In the event of a complete regional outage, the RPO will be influenced by the replication mechanism in place. If the database is asynchronously replicated across regions, there can be some data loss as the replication might not be instantaneous. The minimum achievable RPO for a single region outage will depend on factors such as the replication latency, frequency of replication, and the amount of data generated during the outage window. It could range from minutes to hours or even longer, depending on the setup and configuration.
